Hard times are hitting salmon communities across the world. In an effort to get our salmon neighbours get back on their fins, my team built [Snow2Flow](https://s2f.ucsrb.org/). Snow2Flow will tell you what happens to the river if you do something to the forest BEFORE you do it.

Fish are moving north to escape the heat. Fish are stateless, and so we have to guess at the number of migrants. The Pinsky Lab at Rutgers University comes up with the best guesses. They asked me to create [OceanAdapt](https://oceanadapt.rutgers.edu/) so you can compare your guesses to what they came up with.

Everyone knows the feeling of having a really really good idea! Then forgetting that idea. Some ideas are not forgotten and get turned into common knowledge. Only to be forgotten later by everyone everywhere! Lost knowledge is 3rd worse thing (2nd is biodiversity loss, 1st is Florida). My team built a knowledge safe, [ITKDB](https://itkdb.org/about/) that is open source and free to use by any tribe. The tribe explicitly chooses who can open the safe. My invitations seem to have gotten lost in the mail.
