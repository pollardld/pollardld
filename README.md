*Putting the work in*  

**Hard times are hitting salmon communities** across the world. In an effort to get our salmon neighbours get back on their fins, we built [Snow2Flow](https://s2f.ucsrb.org/). Snow2Flow will tell you what happens to the river if you do something to the forest BEFORE you do it.  

**Fish are moving north** to escape the heat. Fish are not as easy to track as people, so we have to guess their whereabouts. The Pinsky Lab at Rutgers University comes up good guesses. They asked me to create [OceanAdapt](https://oceanadapt.rutgers.edu/).

Everyone knows the feeling of having a really really good idea! Then forgetting that idea. Some ideas are not forgotten and get turned into common knowledge. Only to be forgotten later by everyone everywhere! Knowledge is a terrible thing to waste. We built a knowledge safe, [ITKDB](https://itkdb.org/about/) that is open source and free to use by anyone (made for tribes).
