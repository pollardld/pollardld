**It is a pleasure for you to meet me:**  

  * 🌲 I represent the photoautotrophs.
  * 🌫️ a marine layer inversion 🌁 is the advection layer for me (fog).
  * I am a vast system of mostly 🦠 microrganisms & H<sup>2</sup>0 💧 
  * Hey 👀 we have one 🌎 and a bunch of us live here 🌻 🍄 🐞 🦗 🐙 🦥 🦔 🌴
  * My science is a slow computer science. Low 🪤 efficiency optimization. High resilancy.  

**Care to solve a riddle?**
